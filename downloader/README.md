# DBVirus â€• Downloader

The Downloader offers an API to download sequences pre processed by the Searcher module.
It offers two main modes of operation: sequential and targeted.

In the **sequential mode**, the Downloader acquires the next non-downloaded SRR available.

The **targeted mode** on the other hand downloads a sequence given its SRR number. If that SRR
wasnt't processed by the Searcher, the Downloader will issue an error by default. This behavior,
while it may seem odd if you consider the Downloader as a stand-alone tool, is justified by
the fact that this code _wasn't meant to be ran in a stand-alone manner!_. If you wish to do
so, you probably may be better off running [fasterq-dump](https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/tree/master/tools/fasterq-dump) directly.
